	Within the scope of crime recidivism, algorithms tend to use two types of data - interaction wth police and questionnaires. While race is never used as a data point, some of the model inputs, such as zip code and previous interactions with police, serve as proxies. Those with higher likelihoods of recidivism are more likely to receive a longer sentence, which  leads to more disconnect from society and thus, could increase the rate of recidivism. This feedback loop stems from the flaws model, which is a result of the desire for accurate predictions rather than fundamental explanations and understanding.
	Whereas the crime recidivism model demonstrates negative feedback loop effects, algorithmic hiring within firms demonstrate positive but exclusionary feedback effects. When firms look for potential success in candidates, they search for traits present in senior leadership. Due to societal factors and perhaps firm practices, senior leadership within companies tend to be male-dominant, thus, biasing the algorithm. While the algorithm may be useful for identifying potentially successful male candidates, it will categorically fail for half of the population, generating large opportunity costs for the firm in the process.
	The need for more accurate algorithm inputs is prevalent in the case of teacher evaluations. The job of a teacher extends beyond test scores, which is the crux of the evaluation. The structure of the model, however, essentially scores teachers on the error term. This leads to wide swings in teachersâ€™ scores, and also to hiring and firing decisions that may be otherwise unfounded.
